# ISS Space Tunes

---

Hyper Island - If this, then that Module - Brief 2.

### :open_file_folder: The Brief:

Create a website using date() and localstorage().

### :hourglass_flowing_sand: Time spent / Deadline:

1 week.

### :dart: Goals:

- Make use of an API.
- Integrate key brief requirements of date() and localstorage().
- Develop Git workflow for remote and local collaboration with our team.
- Create a media player, which can shuffle songs.
- Integrate with Spotify api to find the top song over each country.
- Have an SVG rocket that would animate with the playing tracks BMP.
- Have a large vinyl on screen that will display the album artwork.

### :mechanical_arm: Solution:

We started brainstorming and pinned down the idea.

The concept was to use lat/long coordinates provided from the International Space Station api (Where the ISS) to pick the top track in each country the ISS was orbiting and play it.

### :anger: Challenges:

We figured out fairly quickly the ISS spends quite a bit of time over the Ocean (with no top tunes ðŸ˜³). We were able to find a solution using ambient Ocean tracks and light-hearted comments that appear at randomly generated intervals as though someone was looking out of the station.

We intended to use the Spotify api to select the top track in each country. Due to the short deadline, we focused on pushing our MVP and chose to hard code track data in a JSON file.
